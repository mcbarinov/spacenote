# SpaceNote Core Concepts

SpaceNote is a flexible note-taking system where users create custom "spaces" for different purposes (task tracking, journals, catalogs, etc.).

## Core Philosophy

SpaceNote is designed primarily for individuals who need flexible, customizable note organization for their personal notes. It can also serve small teams. Rather than imposing rigid structures, it allows users to define their own data schemas through "spaces" - each tailored to specific use cases.
